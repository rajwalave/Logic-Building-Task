# Logic Building Task – 1 

This repository contains Python solutions for foundational logic-building exercises. These tasks focus on essential programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, string manipulation, and list processing.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this assignment is to solve five real-world logic problems using Python. Each script is designed to be clean, readable, and well-documented.

### 1. User Login Check
* **Goal:** Simulate an authentication system.
* **Logic:** Compares input credentials against stored constants.
* **Output:** Returns "Login Successful" or "Invalid Credentials".

### 2. Pass / Fail Analyzer
* **Goal:** Academic evaluation system.
* **Logic:** Iterates through a list of marks to count students meeting the passing threshold (≥ 50).
* **Output:** Displays total counts for both 'Pass' and 'Fail' students.

### 3. Simple Data Cleaner
* **Goal:** Data preprocessing for analysis.
* **Logic:** Cleans a list of strings by removing leading/trailing whitespace and converting them to lowercase.
* **Output:** Returns a standardized list of names.

### 4. Message Length Analyzer
* **Goal:** Text filtering and validation.
* **Logic:** Measures the length of strings and flags any message exceeding 10 characters.
* **Output:** Detailed breakdown of message lengths with flags.

### 5. Error Message Detector
* **Goal:** Monitoring and log analysis.
* **Logic:** Scans system logs to count occurrences of the "ERROR" status.
* **Output:** Displays the total error count for system health checks.
